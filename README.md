# Tanedo Group Website 2025

Hosted at  [particle.ucr.edu](https://particle.ucr.edu)
**Flip Tanedo**, flip.tanedo@ucr.edu
September 2024 
Based on [HugoBlox](https://hugoblox.com) 

I periodically re-do my personal website from scratch using the latest ~~Hugo Theme Academic~~ ~~Wowchemy~~ [HugoBlox](https://hugoblox.com) Academic CV template. Most of the material in this document copied from earlier websites. This `README.md` file is a personal reminder of how I edited the page; I revise it each time I  edit the page. 

See [Hugo Notes](HugoNotes.md) for links and general Hugo(Blox) references.

## Using Hugo Reminder

Make sure you have Hugo e.g. through Homebrew. If it's been a while, you may want to update (up**grade**) hugo using `brew upgrade hugo` at the terminal. 

`hugo server -D` 

The output will include a URL: `Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/`, navigate your browser to this URL to view the page. [Link for convenience](http://localhost:1313/).

## HugoBlox Notes

* The best place to get help and to see version updates is the [research.dev](https://discord.gg/6mmTvFUY) (HugoBlox) Discord server. The `#announcements` channel summarizes all the updates. 
* In 2024, HugoBlox moved from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS as its CSS framework. This broke a *lot* of my workflow from previous years. This year I am rebuilding from scratch while learning Tailwind. 
* **Strategy**: I'm not going to touch Tailwind at all this round. I'll try to keep my CSS factored out so that in the future I can go over a CSS file and Tailwind-ify it. 

**Build information**

From `hugoblox.yaml`: `hugo_version: '0.126.3'`
From `go.mod`: `blox-tailwind v0.2.1-0.20240602133901-492e343c2a33`

## Quick comparison

Here's what the 2023 version looked like: (the 2024 page looks the same)

## Initialize

Make sure you have installed Hugo. 

1. Go to [HugoBlox Academic CV Template](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/academic-cv/) and click on **Edit**. This takes you to GitHub where you are invited to *create a new repository*. Go ahead and create this repository. 

   * Repository name: `FlipWebsite2025`
   * You can choose either public or private (you need to use **public** if you are deploying on GitHub pages)

2. Pull the code locally, e.g. `Code` > `GitHub CLI` 

   ![Screenshot 2024-03-25 at 10.35.39â€¯AM](figures/image-20240901182929748.png)

   * Copy the `gh repo clone....` line
   * Runin a terminal at the parent director of the new website. For me, this is `/Documents/Website/` where further subdirectories correspond to different generations of the website. (*I know I'm "doing  version control wrong."*) This creates `/Documents/Website/FlipWebsite2025/` and populates it with the HugoBlox Academic CV template. 

3. **Move a copy of *this* file!** From the previous folder,`/Documents/Website/FlipWebsite2024/` , copy `README.md` and `figures/` to the new folder. The `figures/` folder contains images for this file and is unrelated to the website files. You may overwrite the template `README.md` from HugoBlox. 

4. Copy over `.gitignore` from the previous version. This file is not visible by default in the macOS Finder app. Use the terminal. From `/FlipWebsite2024`, run

   ```
   cp .gitignore ../FlipWebsite2025/
   ```

5. If you want to deploy to GitHub Pages as a staging ground, you can folowo these instructions: https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/deployment/ (I'm doing this so I can compare this new page to my previously published page.)

6. Start hacking the template by copying over bits from the old site. The steps for this are summarized below. As you go through this, update the `README.md` file accordingly. You future self will thank you (take this moment to thank me).

# From Scratch Set Up

This is a possibly temporary section as I navigate the Tailwind-based template for the first time. All file structure is relative to `FlipWebsite2025/`

1. [Edit the Biography](https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/resume/step-2/). Go to `./content/authors/admin/_index.md`
   * Update everything. Comment out what you don't need.
   * Upload a new profile photo as  `./content/authors/admin/avatar.jpg`. I don't like how much the default scales down the photo quality. <mark>This is something to fix later.</mark>
2. Update site information. Go to `./config/_default/`
   * `hugo.yaml`: Update website name and URL
   * `menus.yaml`: comment out everything except bio for now
   * `params.yaml`: 
     * `mode: light`: I don't want to make two versions of all of my design elements yet
     * `navbar`: turn off search and theme chooser, name as logo text
     * Enable math
3. Transfer images. Copy over `./assets/media` including `icon.png`, a 512x512 favicon.
4. Transfer the `./static` folder. This one has lots of potentially large files. It is a good time to do housekeeping to remove anything that is no longer being used.  It looks like there's a new suggested folder called `./static/uploads` where one is meant to place files like a CV. Instead, I have my own `./static/files/` subdirectory.

## Download Template Files

Prepare a `/layouts_templates` folder. This is a place to store a copy of the HugoBlox template layouts. We use these to make customized templates that we transfer into the `/layouts` folder. 

* **Background**: Refer to the [Hugo Blox: Extend Hugo Blox documentation](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/extend/#override-a-component); you need to match the template to the module version; this is trivial if you're doing a fresh install. (From GitHub: Code > Download ZIP)
* You'll need to download a local copy of [HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) and copy the `/modules/blox-tailwind/layouts` to a new `./layouts_templates` folder. 
* We will copy files from `layouts_templates` into `layouts` to overrwrite components as needed. 
* Add a line in `.gitignore` with `layouts_templates/` so that we we don't re-upload these reference files to GitHub. (You shouldn't need to do this if the previous `.gitignore` already included this and you copied it over.)
* Do the same for the assets folder. Copy `/modules/blox-tailwind/assets/` to a new `./assets_templates/` folder. Add `assets_templates` to `.gitignore`, if it is not already there.

A useful guideline: when I make edits to a template file, clearly demarcate those edits with generous comment tags. This help if I need to find these changes later.



### Notes how CSS files are processed

Take a look at `./assets_templates/css/` to see how HugoBlox organizes its CSS files. `styles.css` imports the `all.css` files in each directory, which each in turn call the other CSS files in their directories. 

## Navbar

### Background

The navigation bar template is `./layouts/partials/components/headers/navbar.html`. (Create this if needed, copying from `./layouts_templates`.)

The CSS that describes the navigation bar is in `./assets/css/blox/navbar.css`. Copy this from `./assets_templates/` and edit the file. I didn't end up editing this for this round.

### What I did

I renamed the navbar template to `./layouts/partials/components/headers/navbarflip.html` and updated `./config/_default/params.yaml` to have: 

```
# Site header
header:
  navbar:
    enable: true
    blox: "navbarflip"
```

`navbarflip.html` has two primary edits at the top:

```
<!-- FLIP DEL -->
<!-- <header id="site-header" class="header"> -->
<!-- /FLIP -->
<!-- FLIP ADD -->
<header id="site-header" class="header" style="background-color: #012622; color: white">
<!-- /FLIP -->

  <nav class="navbar px-3 flex justify-left">
    <div class="order-0 h-100">
      <!-- Brand -->
<!-- FLIP DEL -->
      <!-- <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ site.Home.RelPermalink }}" title="{{ site.Title }}"> -->
<!-- /FLIP -->
<!-- FLIP ADD -->
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ site.Home.RelPermalink }}" title="{{ site.Title }}" style="color: white">
<!-- /FLIP -->
```

I've changed the color of the navbar to ~~black~~ very dark green (#012622) and the text (and links) to white.

### In the future

* This looks surprisingly okay.



## Biography

The CSS that describes the navigation bar is in `./assets/css/blox/biography.css`. Copy this from `./assets_templates/` and edit the file.

## Blox edits

### Blox CSS Files

The CSS for all of the blox is in `./assets/css/blox/`. You can see that `all.css` simply imports the other CSS files. This gives a framework for how to organize the way you introduce custom CSS for different blox. 

## Notes

* Responsive design: the phone view looks weird for default blox: no margin.
